The truck was in the process of turning when a motorcyclist approached at high speed. To avoid a collision, the motorcyclist performed a tactical roll. The primary reason for this near-miss was the motorcyclist's failure to slow down when approaching the turning truck, suggesting recklessness or lack of caution. The incident could have been prevented if the motorcyclist had reduced speed. Associated traffic rule violations include speeding and potentially reckless driving by the motorcyclist.",
