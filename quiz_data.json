The driver was potentially unaware of the cyclist and the potential danger. This incident constituted a traffic rule violation due to the failure to use proper indicators at a roundabout and could have been prevented if the driver had used appropriate signaling before making their maneuver.",

A car and a two-wheeler were attempting to overtake on the bend, while the dashcam vehicle was driving normally. The primary reason for the near-miss was the unsafe overtaking maneuver. This event involved traffic rule violations including unsafe overtaking and potentially crossing solid lane markings. The incident could have been prevented if the car and two-wheeler drivers had refrained from overtaking on the hairpin bend and followed proper road safety guidelines.",
